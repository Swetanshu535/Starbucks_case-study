# Starbucks_case-study
Starbucks_case study contains data that which is analysed using excel function 

I recently worked on a data analysis project using a Starbucks dataset to uncover insights into the nutritional content of their beverages. The dataset included information such as Beverage Category, Beverage, Beverage Preparation, Calories, Total Fat (g), Trans Fat (g), Saturated Fat (g), Sodium (mg), Total Carbohydrates (g), and Cholesterol (mg).

Using Excel, I applied several key functions to enhance the analysis. I started by merging the dataset to incorporate the name of the data and ensure consistency. To organize the information for better insights, I used custom sorting, arranging the calories in descending order and total fat in ascending order, which provided a clear view of the most and least calorie-dense beverages while minimizing fat content.

Next, I utilized the filter function to narrow the data down to drinks only, excluding other non-beverage items. To streamline calculations, I named specific data ranges, which made it easier to reference and perform operations. One of my key tasks was to calculate the total calories for all drinks, which gave a comprehensive view of the caloric impact of Starbucks beverages.

I also focused on cholesterol, summing up the total cholesterol for all drinks to understand their potential health implications. Lastly, I calculated the average calorie count for espresso drinks, providing a focused analysis of a popular beverage category.

This project not only allowed me to dive deeper into data analytics but also enhanced my Excel skills, especially in using advanced functions like custom sorting, filtering, and named ranges.
